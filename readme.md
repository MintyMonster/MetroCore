# MetroCore
MetroCore is a Minecraft plugin with the sole purpose of providing useful and effective core commands for Metrocity. The plugin contains Discord implementation between the Metrocity Discord server and the Minecraft server. The plugin also contains SQLite databases to store relevent information.

# How to use
Download the repository and use a Java compiler and compile it to a Jar file. From there, you can install the Jar file directly into your server's FTP file access plugin folder.

# Disclaimer
Metrocore only works on Minecraft 1.16.5.
Due to the unfinished nature of the plugin, I cannot guarantee stability.
